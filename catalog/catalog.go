// Package catalog is ddmus' music catalog: the albums, artists, tracks
// and playlists known across providers, and which of them are in the user's
// library. It defines the types and the interface the UI reads through; it
// holds no SQL and no Bubbletea. catalog/sqlite implements it, and
// catalogsync keeps it current from the providers.
//
// Every object has an internal ID owned by the catalog. The provider's own ID
// (Provider, ProviderID) is kept alongside it and is unique, but is never the
// catalog's key.
