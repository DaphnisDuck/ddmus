# The music catalog

ddmus keeps your Spotify library and an index of your local music folder in one SQLite database, `~/.local/share/ddmus/library.db`. The library screens read from it, so lists open instantly and keep working offline. Playback still goes to Spotify, or to the file itself.

## What it holds

- **Spotify:** saved albums, followed artists, liked songs, and the playlists you own or follow, with their tracks. Album track lists are cached as you open albums, and in the background for the rest of your saved albums.
- **YouTube Music:** your music playlists (and those listed in `youtube_playlists`) with their tracks, and Liked Music. Each track's artist, album and year is read in the background, which gives YouTube its Albums and Artists; an album holds only the tracks of it you have. See [youtube.md](youtube.md).
- **Local:** every audio file under the music folder, grouped into albums, artists and genres. The folder is `initial_directory` in `config.toml`, else `$XDG_MUSIC_DIR`, else `~/Music`.
- **Radio:** your favorite stations and the built-in and `radios.toml` stations, so [search](search.md) finds them. They are read from local files at every start and whenever you star or unstar a station. Browsing Radio still reads them directly.
- **Search index:** a full-text index of everything above, kept in step with every change. See [search.md](search.md).
- **Not in the catalog:** the radio directory, local playlists, and an artist's full Spotify discography. These are always loaded live.

No account passwords or tokens are stored in the catalog: Spotify and YouTube credentials stay in `~/.config/ddmus/` (`spotify_credentials.json`, `ytmusic_credentials.json`). A radio station's URL is stored as written, so a station URL that carries a password or token puts it in the catalog. The catalog file and its folder are readable only by you.

## When it updates

| Source | At startup | On `r` | After a failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spotify | if the last successful sync is older than `spotify_refresh` (30 minutes by default) | yes | retries after 1 minute, doubling up to every 30 minutes |
| YouTube Music | if the last successful sync is older than `youtube_refresh` (2 hours by default) | yes | the same retries |
| Local | always; only files whose size or modification time changed are read again | yes | the same retries |

A Spotify sync first asks for your saved albums' and liked songs' count and newest item (one request each). When both match the catalog, that list is not read again; it is still read in full at least once a day, so renamed titles and new artwork arrive. Playlists are refetched only when Spotify's version marker changed.

`r` syncs the source you're browsing. At the Music root it syncs every source. Syncs run in the background, and the screen refreshes in place when one lands, keeping the cursor on the same item.

**Spotify album tracks:** opening an album whose tracks aren't cached yet loads it from Spotify and caches it. A background fill then caches your other saved albums one at a time, newest saved first, one every 10 seconds. It pauses while you open an album or a sync runs, and when Spotify rate-limits it, it waits as long as Spotify asks (at least 5 seconds, doubling up to 10 minutes).

**Spotify rate limits:** Spotify can block a client for hours when it asks too much (seen: 20 hours on a development-mode client ID). While a block lasts, ddmus sends Spotify nothing: syncs, the fill and album opens fail at once with "rate limited until" and the time, and a failed sync retries when the block ends. Short waits (30 seconds or less) are waited out in the request. The block is kept in `library.db`, so restarting ddmus does not ask Spotify again early.

## Status

The top of the library shows each source's state:

- `↻ syncing`
- `✓ synced 2m ago`
- `sync failed · cached`: the last attempt failed, and you're browsing what the catalog already holds.

With both Spotify and Local, each status is prefixed with its source. Details of a failure are in `~/.config/ddmus/cliamp.log`.

## Failure safety

A sync either applies completely or changes nothing:

- **Spotify:** if any page of a collection fails, or the library changes while it's being read, that collection keeps what it had.
- **Local:** if the music folder is missing, or is empty while the catalog holds files (an unmounted drive, for example), the index is left as it is. Files under a folder ddmus can't read are kept too.
- **Sign-in:** a Spotify sign-in that fails because Spotify is unreachable or down is reported as that error, not as "sign-in required". The sync retries by itself.

## Settings

In `~/.config/ddmus/config.toml`:

```toml
[ddmus]
spotify_refresh = "30m"   # sync Spotify at startup if the last sync is older than this; "0s" syncs every time
youtube_refresh = "2h"    # the same for YouTube Music
youtube_playlists = []    # other people's YouTube playlists to sync, by link (see youtube.md)
```

Durations use Go's format: `90s`, `30m`, `2h`. An invalid value keeps the default.

## Starting over

The catalog can always be rebuilt from Spotify and your music folder. To reset it, quit ddmus and delete `~/.local/share/ddmus/library.db`, along with the `library.db-wal` and `library.db-shm` files next to it. The next start syncs everything again.
