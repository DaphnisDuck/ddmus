# Library navigation

ddmus opens on **Music**, a library hierarchy that sits above cliamp's playback chrome. Now playing, progress, volume, EQ and the visualizer stay where they were.

- **All Music:** Albums and Artists from Spotify, YouTube Music and Local in one list each, every row labelled with its source. The same album or artist in both stays two rows, side by side. Opening a row goes to that source's own album or artist.
- **Spotify:**
  - **Albums** are your saved albums.
  - **Artists** are the artists you follow; each one opens their albums and singles.
  - **Playlists** are the ones you own or follow.
  - **Liked Songs** is your saved tracks.
- **YouTube Music:** your music playlists, Liked Music, and the albums and artists read from those tracks in the background. See [youtube.md](youtube.md).
- **Local:**
  - **Albums**, **Artists** and **Genres** come from an index of your music directory: `initial_directory` from config, else `$XDG_MUSIC_DIR`, else `~/Music`. Files are grouped into albums by album tag within a folder (per-disc folders like `CD1` stay one album); an album with several track artists is credited to Various Artists and listed under each of them.
  - **Folders** opens the file browser.
  - **Playlists** are your saved local playlists.
- **Radio:**
  - **Favorites** are your starred stations. Enter plays one.
  - **Browse Stations** lists the cliamp radio channels and the station directory by country or tag.
- **Search:** searches everything the catalog holds as you type; `/` opens it from anywhere. See [search.md](search.md). Without a catalog it is the provider's own search (Spotify if configured, else Local).

Lists sort A–Z as names are written ("The Planets" under T), ignoring case, accents and leading punctuation. Albums sort by title; press `o` to sort by artist instead. Radio favorites sort by name; stations under a country or tag keep the directory's most-voted-first order.

Enter on a track replaces the queue with the list it's in and starts at that track, the way an album plays. The library stays on screen.

## The catalog and sync

Spotify, YouTube Music and Local browsing read from a local catalog (`~/.local/share/ddmus/library.db`), so lists open instantly and work offline; your radio stations are in it too, for search. Spotify and YouTube Music sync at startup when their last sync is older than their refresh setting, Local re-indexes changed files at every startup, and `r` syncs the source you're browsing. The header shows each source's status (`↻ syncing`, `✓ synced 2m ago`, `sync failed · cached`). See [catalog.md](catalog.md) for what's cached, failure safety, and the `[ddmus]` settings.

## Keys

The bar at the bottom of each view lists every key that works there, and only those. It wraps onto more lines when the keys don't fit on one; `Ctrl+G` hides it. A terminal too short for the whole bar keeps at least three rows for the list and shows the bar's first lines.

### Library

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `j` `k` / `↓` `↑` | Move (wraps) |
| `g` `G` / `Home` `End` | Top / bottom |
| `Ctrl+D` `Ctrl+U` / `PgDn` `PgUp` | Page down / up |
| `l` `Enter` `→` | Open, or play |
| `h` `Esc` `Backspace` `←` | Back; at Music, nothing |
| `q` | Quit |
| `/` | Search |
| `r` | Sync the source you're browsing now (everything, at Music) |
| `o` | In an Albums list, switch between sorting by title and by artist |
| `Space` | Play / pause |
| `Tab` | Show the queue |
| `p` `n` | Previous / next track |
| `s` | Stop |
| `+` `-` | Volume |
| `Ctrl+G` | Hide or show the key bar |

On an error screen, Enter retries. When Spotify needs you to sign in, Enter starts sign-in in your browser and reloads once it finishes.

In search results, `/`, `Esc` and `h` return to the query; while typing, Enter or Tab moves to the results, `Esc` closes search and `Ctrl+U` clears the query. See [search.md](search.md).

### Queue

`Tab` shows the queue (Now Playing): the tracks playing, with the settings panel beside them. `Tab`, `Esc` or `b` returns to the library.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `j` `k` / `↓` `↑`, `g` `G`, `PgUp` `PgDn` | Move, as in the library |
| `Enter` | Play the selected track |
| `Space` | Play / pause |
| `←` `→` | Seek 5 seconds; `Shift+←` `Shift+→` seek by the large step |
| `p` `n` | Previous / next track |
| `s` | Stop |
| `+` `-` | Volume |
| `/` | Filter the queue |
| `z` | Shuffle on / off |
| `r` | Repeat: off, all, one |
| `a` | Play the selected track next (again to take it back) |
| `A` | Up next: the tracks queued with `a` |
| `x` | Remove the selected track; `Ctrl+Z` undoes it |
| `Shift+↑` `Shift+↓` | Move the selected track up / down |
| `e` | Next EQ preset |
| `[` `]` | Speed down / up |
| `i` | Track info |
| `y` | Lyrics |
| `Ctrl+J` | Jump to a time |
| `q` | Quit |
| `Ctrl+G` | Hide or show the key bar |

Track info, lyrics, Up next and Jump open over the queue; `Esc` returns to it.

`q` quits ddmus at once from every library screen, the queue, and the overlays over it; only where you are typing (search, the queue filter, Jump) is it a letter. `Esc` always goes back one step (overlay → queue → Library, results → query → closed search, a list → its parent) and never quits. `r` means repeat in the queue and sync in the library.

Mono has no key while the library is enabled; `mono = true` in config.toml, `--mono` or `ddmus mono` still turn it on, and the settings line shows `[M]` while it is.

The settings panel shows the queue's settings: **SRC** is the playing track's source (`[Spotify]`, `[YouTube]`, `[Local]`, `[Radio]`), then volume, EQ, shuffle, repeat and speed. It is display only; the keys above change it. For a track the library didn't start (a file or URL given on the command line, the file browser, a provider's own search), SRC shows what the track's path tells, or nothing.

## Disabled cliamp keys

Keys that jump to other parts of cliamp are disabled, including provider switching (`S`, `R`, `L`, `N`, …), the pickers (`t`, `v`, `d`), `u`, `p`, `w`, Favorite (`n`), Metadata (`Ctrl+I`, which terminals send as Tab) and the keymap overlay (`?`, `Ctrl+K`). The key bar replaces the overlay; `Ctrl+K` still opens it over cliamp's own screens.

Each view's keys come from one table in `ui/model/library_keymap.go`: the library's own keys, then the cliamp keys it passes through. The gate passes exactly the cliamp keys the table lists, and the key bar shows the same table, so a cliamp key works in a view if and only if its bar lists it. The library's own keys are handled in `handleLibraryKey` (`ui/model/library_nav.go`); a new one needs a row in the table too. To bring a cliamp key back, add a row to the view's table.
