# ddsonic files and names

DaphnisDuck's Music Player (`ddsonic`) keeps its own files and runtime names, so it can be installed and run alongside cliamp.

| What | ddsonic | cliamp |
|---|---|---|
| Config (config.toml, playlists, history, resume, radio favorites, credentials, log, IPC socket) | `~/.config/ddsonic` | `~/.config/cliamp` |
| Data (music catalog `library.db`, embedded album art extracted for MPRIS) | `~/.local/share/ddsonic` | `~/.local/share/cliamp` |
| Downloaded album artwork for the info view (`artwork/`, trimmed past 100 MB; safe to delete) | `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/ddsonic`, else `~/.cache/ddsonic` | — |
| Default downloads (`Ctrl+S`) | `~/Music/ddsonic` | `~/Music/cliamp` |
| MPRIS (media keys) | `org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.ddsonic` | `org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.cliamp` |
| Client name and device ID reported to Plex, Navidrome, Emby, Jellyfin and podcast servers | `ddsonic` | `cliamp` |
| PulseAudio/PipeWire stream matched when switching output device | `ddsonic` | `cliamp` |
| Config override variable | `DDSONIC_CONFIG_DIR` | `CLIAMP_CONFIG_DIR` |

All of these come from `internal/appdir/ddsonic.go` (`Name`, `ConfigDirEnv`, `DownloadsDir`); `internal/appmeta` derives its client name from `appdir.Name`.

- **Config directory order:** `CLIAMP_CONFIG_DIR`, then `DDSONIC_CONFIG_DIR`, then `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ddsonic`, then `~/.config/ddsonic`. `CLIAMP_CONFIG_DIR` comes first because upstream's tests set it to isolate themselves, and exporting `DDSONIC_CONFIG_DIR` must not send them to your real config. So don't export `CLIAMP_CONFIG_DIR` globally if you run both players. Under `go test`, `DDSONIC_CONFIG_DIR` is ignored entirely, so tests never touch your real config.
- **File names:** the log is `ddsonic.log` and the IPC socket `ddsonic.sock` (with `ddsonic.sock.pid`). Before 1.0 they kept upstream's names, `cliamp.log` and `cliamp.sock`, and in `v1.0.0-rc.1` they were `ddmus.log` and `ddmus.sock`; a script that opens the socket by path needs the new name, and an old log can be deleted.
- **CLI subcommands:** `ddsonic pause`, `ddsonic next` and the rest talk to the ddsonic socket, so they control ddsonic and never cliamp.

## Moving from ddmus (1.0.0-rc.1 and earlier)

Until `v1.0.0-rc.1` this player was called ddmus and kept its files under that name. ddsonic does not read, move or delete them: started without its own folders, it begins empty, with no settings, sign-ins or library, and the ddmus folders stay as they are. To carry everything over, quit ddmus and move the folders once:

```sh
mv -T ~/.config/ddmus ~/.config/ddsonic
mv -T ~/.local/share/ddmus ~/.local/share/ddsonic
[ -d ~/.cache/ddmus ] && mv -T ~/.cache/ddmus ~/.cache/ddsonic
sed -i -E 's/^[[:space:]]*\[ddmus\][[:space:]]*$/[ddsonic]/I' ~/.config/ddsonic/config.toml
```

- **Quit ddmus first.** `library.db` is an SQLite database with a write-ahead log (`library.db-wal`, `library.db-shm`); moving it while ddmus runs can lose its latest changes. `ddmus status` says whether one is running.
- **If you already started ddsonic once**, it created `~/.config/ddsonic` and `~/.local/share/ddsonic`. Remove them first: `mv -T` refuses to move onto a folder that holds anything.
- **The section header matters.** ddsonic reads `[ddsonic]` and ignores `[ddmus]` without a message, so `spotify_refresh`, `youtube_refresh`, `youtube_playlists`, `border` and `artwork` fall back to their defaults until the header is changed. The `sed` line does it, however the header is capitalised or indented.
- **What comes along:** `config.toml`, the Spotify and YouTube Music sign-ins, radio favorites, playlists, history, the resume position, themes, and the catalog with everything it has synced. Nothing inside these files names the config, data or cache folders, so no file needs editing but `config.toml`.
- **Leave `~/Music/ddmus` where it is.** Tracks saved with `Ctrl+S` went there, and the history, the resume position, playlists and the catalog remember each of them by its full path; moving or renaming the folder breaks every one of those. ddsonic saves new tracks to `~/Music/ddsonic`. To keep saving into the old folder instead, set it in `config.toml`, as a full path (`~` is not expanded here):

  ```toml
  [downloads]
  directory = "/home/you/Music/ddmus"
  ```

  If you do rename the folder, expect to fix those paths by hand or let them go: press `r` in Local to index the files again, and remove the stale entries from your playlists and history.
- **Leftovers to delete:** `~/.config/ddsonic/ddmus.log`, and `ddmus.sock` and `ddmus.sock.pid` if ddmus did not exit cleanly. ddsonic writes `ddsonic.log` and `ddsonic.sock`.
- **The variable** `DDMUS_CONFIG_DIR` is now `DDSONIC_CONFIG_DIR`. A script that opens the socket by path, or addresses the player over MPRIS as `org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.ddmus`, needs the new name.
- **The binary and the package:** remove the old `ddmus` executable (`~/.local/bin/ddmus` after a `make install`; `rm` it, or uninstall a locally built `ddmus-bin`). ddsonic installs as `ddsonic`, and its AUR package is `ddsonic-bin`.

To start over instead, do nothing: ddsonic starts empty, `ddsonic setup` sets up Spotify, YouTube Music and the Local music folder, and the ddmus folders can be deleted when you no longer want them.

## Moving from omatunes (before v0.6)

Until v0.6 this player was called omatunes. It does not read or move those files either, since `~/.config/omatunes` may belong to the unrelated omatunes player. The steps are the ones above with `omatunes` in place of `ddmus` (the section header was `[omatunes]`, the variable `OMATUNES_CONFIG_DIR`, and the log `cliamp.log`). Check first that the folders are this player's: they hold `config.toml`, `library.db` and a log.

## Moving settings from cliamp

ddsonic does not read cliamp's directory. To start from your cliamp settings, copy them once:

```sh
rsync -a --exclude='*.log' --exclude='*.sock' ~/.config/cliamp/ ~/.config/ddsonic/
rsync -a ~/.local/share/cliamp/ ~/.local/share/ddsonic/
```

## Still shared

- **Spotify sign-in:**
  - A copied `spotify_credentials.json` holds the same Spotify refresh token as cliamp's. If Spotify rotates the token for one app, the other asks you to sign in again. Run `ddsonic spotify reset` for a separate sign-in.
  - Both apps use the fixed OAuth callback port `127.0.0.1:19872`, so don't sign in to both at the same moment.
- **`cliamp://` links:** ddsonic 1.0 neither registers nor handles them; they are cliamp's. If you ran `protocol register` with a version before 1.0 (as ddmus or omatunes), it wrote `cliamp-url-handler.desktop` in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/applications` (usually `~/.local/share/applications`), the same file cliamp uses. Look at its `Exec=` line: if it runs ddmus or omatunes, delete the file and run `update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications`. If it runs cliamp, leave it. If you use cliamp, `cliamp protocol register` writes its own entry again.

## After an upstream merge

Upstream tests hard-code `cliamp` as a path segment under a temporary HOME. ddsonic rewrites those literals. If a merge brings in new ones, re-apply the rewrite:

```sh
files=$(grep -rl --include=*_test.go -E '"\.config", "cliamp"|"Music", "cliamp"|share", "cliamp"|\.config/cliamp' . | grep -v upgrade/)
sed -i -E 's/"\.config", "cliamp"/".config", "ddsonic"/g; s/"Music", "cliamp"/"Music", "ddsonic"/g; s/("share", )"cliamp"/\1"ddsonic"/g; s#\.config/cliamp#.config/ddsonic#g' $files
```
