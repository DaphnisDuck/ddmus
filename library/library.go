// Package library is ddmus' application-owned navigation model: the
// Music → source → concept → item hierarchy the UI walks. It knows nothing
// about Bubbletea; ui/model renders Levels and acts on Entries.
//
// Providers own content and capabilities; adapters in this package translate
// those capabilities (provider/interfaces.go) into Levels. From Milestone 2 the
// adapters read the catalog instead of calling providers, and the UI does not
// change — Level is that seam.
