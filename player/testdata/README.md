## tone-440hz.mp3

A two-second 440 Hz sine tone, stereo, 44.1 kHz, 64 kbit/s MP3, 16,508 bytes. It is generated, not recorded: it contains no music, speech or sampled material, and nobody else's work. ddmus made it for these tests, and it is covered by the repository's MIT license like the rest of ddmus's source.

`nav_length_test.go` serves it over HTTP as "a real encoded MP3 both decoders accept": the built-in MP3 decoder and ffmpeg.

It was generated with ffmpeg n9.0.1 (libmp3lame):

```sh
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "sine=frequency=440:duration=2:sample_rate=44100" \
    -ac 2 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 64k \
    -map_metadata -1 -fflags +bitexact -flags:a +bitexact \
    -id3v2_version 0 -write_id3v1 0 \
    tone-440hz.mp3
```

SHA-256: `c670384b0bd9759b1d47dd2289958216c9e712084579458dbf450e6d0ceef74e`. The same command gives the same bytes with that ffmpeg; another version may give a different, equally valid file.

It replaces `cliamp_whips_terminal_ass.mp3`, which cliamp added in May 2026 (commit `bd8d5d07`) with no record of where the audio came from or of a license for it. ddmus does not redistribute it.
